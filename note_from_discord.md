## staking

question:
 I'd like to know that e.g. for month 1 the subsidy will be paid out daily/weekly/monthly to your owner/operator/beneficiary address.
answers:
It goes to the beneficiary
Monthly, because of how the intervals work.

The company has 250M allocated in KEEP. Already, the company has sold $2-3M of that for future funding — we'll have a proper announcement soon, but we mentioned IOSG, Digital Strategies, and some other funds — as well as some angels that I believe are good for the network, even though the checks are small for this late stage.

The company has also loaned 75M KEEP — 7.5% of the supply! — to an outside strategic partner. The loan is for 3 years, with an option to repay in USD. The partner is fairly unhandcuffed, but we believe they are heavily incentivized to do what's in the best interest of the network. We could be wrong, but I'm very confident.

We might be able to share that agreement down the road, but haven't been able to yet.

The team, including myself and advisors, are locked up with linear on-chain grants.. but the legal lockups are cliffs. Most are 2 year. Co-founders are 4-year, including me.

Co-founders are also limited to getting KEEP out of the co via legal arrangements.

If the company or strategic partner does something awful, it will be at the expense of me, the team, and early purchasers.

Obviously "what's in the agreement" would be great to know.. not ready for that but I hope to be by end of year.
Here's what we've shared so far - most of which has been verified by Messari and is also in their disclosures registry

One of the things I stress is that the company is a company. No foundation, not a fake populist entity like is so popular in crypto.

Most foundations don't protect token holders, at all. They're typically tax haves, governance havens, or maybe... rarely... something like the Zcash Foundation, run by actualy honest-to-god mission-driven people. Even then, they have a mission that doesn't always align with ZEC holders
All of that said... I recognize anything we can do to make the company's treasury plans concrete will help. Need to finish launching but it's on my mind
Sorry guys, stepping off the soapbox :grinning:
